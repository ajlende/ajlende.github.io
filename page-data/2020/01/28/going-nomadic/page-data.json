We sat in silence with the other folks attending until the last day when we were finally allowed to converse with the people we&#8217;d spent so much time with. Among the people a father and son—the only other Americans there—who were taking the course as the first stop before traveling and working as digital nomads. I had never heard the term &#8220;digital nomad&#8221; before that point, but it intrigued me—going anywhere in the world you want while working from your laptop. I didn&#8217;t know it then, but that would become the most impactful part of the trip—not the meditation that I had gone there for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next two years the thought of becoming a digital nomad never really left me. Eventually, in October 2019 I left my job at Cerner, a healthcare IT company based in Kansas City, to work for Automattic, a fully-distributed company known best for running WordPress.com. With employees spread out around the world, the timezone I was in didn&#8217;t really matter that much anymore. I did a quick round of visits to friends in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Des Moines, and Washington, D.C. before spending some time with my family over Christmas and New Year&#8217;s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I arrived in Lisbon, Portugal with everything I need packed into my 33L travel backpack. I&#8217;ll be here for a month. Wish me luck!</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"id":"ab568c95-3b34-5351-af9e-96afda6b220f"}}}
