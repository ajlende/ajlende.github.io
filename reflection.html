          <p class="left-align light">ISU has prepared me to design software systems through classes like Com S 309 Software Development Practices. Problems that I have solved for class can be applied to engineering problems in the workplace. Software engineering is one of the majors that is really easy to make global change because the internet is becoming more accessible to a wide variety of people every day.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Many classes that I have taken require group work, especially the computer engineering courses with labs associated with them. Teamwork is important in these classes to build a working project that can be presented at the end of the class. In some projects we are allowed to use whatever tools we would like to solve problems, so I have learned and used some of the latest and upcoming frameworks and ideas. For my SE elective I am taking technology and social change which addresses some of the ethical issues with this new technology.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">In many of the projects that I have done for class it has been necessary to use resources beyond what was taught in class. Stack Overflow is the single greatest resource that I used to research and find answers to the questions that I have had in solving problems for projects in and out of classes.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Lifelong learning is a common theme among clubs and organizations that I have been a part of at Iowa State. Technology moves fast, so it is important to stay ahead of the curve and learn fast. It is said to take 10,000 hours, around 10 years, to master a skill. I have been doing software engineering for only 4 years, so there is much to learn before I can consider myself a master programmer. There is a lot to learn along the way.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">For my senior design project, I jumped into computer vision, something that I've had no experience with before. Computer vision is just one of the fascinating facets of software engineering to explore. Jumping in like that is practicing solving new problems and taking risks.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">There is very little that I would have done differently for my undergrad. One thing is that I would have studied abroad to get experience from another perspective other than the Computer Science and Computer Engineering departments at Iowa State. The second thing that I would have done differently is that I would have picked up a minor. I was strongly considering either a business minor or a music technology minor, and I think that either would have helped me have more skills that are applicable to the workplace.</p>
