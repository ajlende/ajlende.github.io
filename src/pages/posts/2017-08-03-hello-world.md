John didn't even know what the `go_to()` function did!

import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { get } from 'axios'

const Page = ({ html }) => (
  <div
    className="container"
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }}
  />
)

class MyComponent extends Component {
  state = { html: '' }
  compoentDidMount() {
    this.getPage('http://example.com')
  }
  async getPage(url) {
    this.setState({ html: await get(url) })
  }
  render() {
    return this.props.show ? <Page html={this.state.html} /> : null
  }
}

MyComponent.defaultProps = {
  show: true,
}

export default MyComponent
```
