                As you probably guessed by the large title at the top of this page, my name is Alex
                Lende (pronounced like lend-y). You can find me most places on the internet as{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/ajlende">@ajlende</a>. I create 3D data visualizations
                with WebGL at <a href="https://www.cerner.com">Cerner</a> in Kansas City.
              </p>

                Most of the time you'll find me writing JavaScript in whatever the current trendy
                framework is (or a new ones that I want to learn about)â€”this means{" "}
                <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> for now, but{" "}
                <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> is looking like a promising candidate for the
                future (and it's not even JS ðŸ˜±). I also spend a good deal of time thinking about
                design and human-computer interaction including everything from brand design to user
                interface design to game design to programming language designâ€”I've been known to
                design the occasional website or logo for someone.

                Outside of tech, I enjoy The Great Outdoorsâ„¢. I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout
                while in the Boy Scouts of America, and still enjoy camping as often as I can. I've
                been to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (<a href="http://bwca.com/index.cfm?">BWCA</a>)
                several times, and I did my first Des Moines Register's Annual Great Bike Ride
                Across Iowa (<a href="https://ragbrai.com/">RAGBRAI</a>) in July 2017.
