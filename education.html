            <h5 class="center">Educational Objective</h5>
            <p class="left-align light">Iowa State University has taught me skills in the field of software engineering, computer science, and computer engineering. I have also learned valuable leadership skills through classes and involvement on campus.</p>
            <h5 class="center">General Education Component</h5>
            <h6>List of General Education Courses</h6>
            <ul class="left-align light">
              <li>Community Leadership and Public Service 322 (3 cr.) (U.S Diversity) (Social Sciences) - Leadership in a Diverse Society</li>
              <li>Psychology 101 (3 cr.) (Social Sciences) - Introdiction to Psychology</li>
              <li>Religon 205 (3 cr.) (International Perspectives) (Arts &amp; Humanities)- Introduction to World Religon</li>
              <li>Economics 101 (3 cr.) - Introduction to Microeconomics</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>General Education Reflection</h6>
            <p class="left-align light">In general I think poorly of the choices that I made to fulfill my general education requirements, but I also think that there was a lacking in the selection of classes offered to fulfill the genereal education requirement in software engineering.</p>
            <!--p class="left-align">What are your current short term (within next one or two years) and long term (next five to ten years) goals? You may include your ideal career in engineering or your preferred working environment.</p-->
            <p class="left-align light">In the short term, my goals are to work with bleeding edge technologies to build software that makes people's lives easier and makes technology more accessable to everyone. In the long term I would like to continue to learn as much as I can both in industry as well as going back to grad school after I have some more experience and a better idea of what I am interested in studying. Unfortunately, very little of the general education requirement has been in line with the goals I have.</p>
            <!--p class="left-align">What have you learned in your general education electives that allow you to evaluate and formulate engineering solutions with problem solving and innovation beyond the technical aspects in problem solving? How do general education classes help you to think about an engineering problem?</p-->
            <p class="left-align light">One of the biggest thing that my general education requirements helped with is getting a better hold on diversity&mdash;what diversity means and how to better work with diverse groups of people. My Leadership in a Diverse Society class was one of my favorite classes that I took in the past four years because it didn't just require you to memorize the history of oppression of some specific group of people, or memorize vocabulary for religous terms around the world, or memorize the names of important people in the field of psychology&mdash;it gave real-world applications of diversity in a leadership environment and taught useful skills that I have used to be a better leader in both school and professionally.</p>
            <!--p class="left-align">Describe specific instances where you used knowledge/skills from general elective courses for innovation in engineering problems. What impact does meshing technical engineering skills and general electives-based innovation have in an economic, global, or societal context?</p-->
            <p class="left-align light">I have used skills from my leadership class to lead teams that I have been on for class projects. Anywhere where there is any sort of group work in a class, I tend to fall into a group leader role, and I think that skills learned in Leadership in a Diverse Socity have helped me fall into that position more naturally. The diversity aspect has helped me understand more how to account for everyone's ideas within a group to make the group more efficeive as a whole.</p>
            <p class="left-align light">In all, I think that the general education system at Iowa State University can be improved significantly by adding a larger variety of classes to the accepted list of Arts and Humanities or Social Sciences lists. The push for having easier electives that you just need to get out of the way has been a push in the wrong direction. General education electives should be actively be pushed to encourage real-world applications of topics learned rather than history, memorization, and vocabulary as they are today. This doesn't mean that no amount of history, memorization, or vocabulary should exist in courses today, but there should also be a connection with application that I don't think that I got in many of my general education courses.</p>
