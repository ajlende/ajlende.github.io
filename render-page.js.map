It’s inspired by the No Man’s Sky wallpaper that I was using at the time. I’d been using the NMS theme at work for a while when a colleague commented on it and asked if there was an Atom variant which prompted me to created one. Now that I’m starting a blog, it made sense to move the NMS theme to a web syntax highlighter, so here we are with Prism-nms. 🙂</p>\\n<p><img
