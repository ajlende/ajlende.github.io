          <p class="left-align light">I worked at Workiva for the past two summers. For both summers I worked on the same team where I worked on the file manager WDesk Home for the WDesk web application. The first summer, the app was written using AngluarJS, so I learned AngularJS. By the tim e I started the second summer, most of the code had been ported over to ReactJS, so I created React components for the page.</p>
