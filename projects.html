            <p class="light">My senior design project is a computer algorithm which is able to detect and track objects in a video stream from a Garmin ViRB action camera. The algorithm will be able to detect a known object and track its movement and size based on the pixels in each frame. It will then be able to accurately predict where the object originated from using physical properties of moving objects.</p>
            <p class="light">This system will run in a low power embedded environment on an ARM micro-controller, and it will be able to run off of a battery source for at least four hours. The tracking data will be streamed in real time from the system over a wired or wireless connection to a computer up to 30 meters away.</p>

The goal was to build a system that users could log into to listen to music they have purchased and stored on their computer via a music server called MPD. I gained some technical knowledge about websockets and sending raw data through as well as settin up a proxy server for pass on the requests from the browser to the user's computer since the browser can't directly interface with it. The site was built using Javascript and the React framework, and the backend was written in Java with a MySQL database.

We would then block in our MatLab environment, listening for a handshake from the robot, confirming the completion of its action, and any data from sensors that it collected. We ploted all sonar and infrared information on a polar graph in our GUI.

It is a small robot using a raspberry pi and NFC card reader to read cards that represent instructions for a program that the robot can execute. We had 14 different instructions including moving, turning, beeping, flashing LED, and even conditional blocks for when a bumper gets hit as well as a repeat card that loops the entire program. The robot has two modes: a program mode, and a run mode. The mode is toggled via a switch, and a button will save the program or start the program depending on the mode. The raspberry pi also serves a simple Node.js server for showing the loaded commands in an animated web interface. This was written in Python and Javascript, and the source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/nmont/BOT">GitHub</a> or via the <a href="http://devpost.com/software/bot-8qec9n">Devpost submission.</a></p></div>

At the time of this hackathon, the Google Cardboard API made it very difficult to use the camera on your phone, so we didn't end up with a very polished product, but we managed to detect a pattern and overlay an image on top of it.
